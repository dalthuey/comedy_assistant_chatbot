# Comedy Assistant Chatbot

Welcome to the **Comedy Assistant Chatbot**! This project leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model to create an interactive chatbot that helps you generate jokes, punchlines, and humorous premises. Whether you need a laugh or help brainstorming witty lines, this bot has you covered.

## Features

- **Feedback Storage**: Saves feedback to a JSON file for analysis and improvement.
